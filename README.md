How to import to idea
---------------------

File -> import project -> select the "simpleanngame" folder location and tick create project from external model -> maven -> finish

Advice from Amila
-----------------
When importing project use create new project from source and later re-import using maven tab.

When importing if we use existing model -> maven method, file templates are getting f****d up (ex. File - > new doesnt show Java Class etc)
